# Security & Regulatory Compliance

This page provides an overview of our commitment to industry-leading security practices and our adherence to key regulatory frameworks, including HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, SOC 2, and FDA requirements.

## 1. Compliance Frameworks

### 1.1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

- **Scope:** Protection of Protected Health Information (PHI)
- **Key Requirements:**
  - **Privacy Rule:** Controls over use and disclosure of PHI
  - **Security Rule:** Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
  - **Breach Notification Rule:** Timely notification in the event of a PHI breach
- **Our Practices:**
  - Risk assessments & remediation plans
  - Encryption of PHI at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
  - Role-based access controls (RBAC) & least-privilege
  - Regular security awareness training for all personnel

### 1.2 21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic Records & Signatures)

- **Scope:** U.S. FDA regulations governing electronic records and signatures for clinical trials and medical devices
- **Key Requirements:**
  - **System Validation:** Ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistent performance
  - **Audit Trails:** Secure, computer-generated time-stamped logs
  - **Electronic Signatures:** Unique user IDs, signature manifestations, and controls to prevent repudiation
- **Our Practices:**
  - Fully versioned audit logs with immutable timestamps
  - Formal software validation lifecycle (IQ/OQ/PQ)
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for signature events
  - Documented change control and release management

### 1.3 SOC 2 (Service Organization Control Report)

- **Scope:** AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Defined controls mapped to each Trust Services Principle
  - Third-party audit by an independent CPA firm
  - Annual reporting and continuous monitoring
- **Our Practices:**
  - Comprehensive security policy suite and control matrix
  - Automated monitoring & alerting (SIEM integration)
  - Incident response plan with defined RACI roles

### 1.4 U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)

- **Scope:** Regulations for medical devices, software as a medical device (SaMD), and clinical software systems
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Quality System Regulation (QSR 21 CFR Part 820)
  - Design controls, risk management (ISO 14971 alignment)
  - Device classification & 510(k) premarket notifications (where applicable)
- **Our Practices:**
  - ISO 13485-aligned Quality Management System (QMS)
  - Design history file (DHF) and risk management documentation
  - Traceability matrix linking requirements → design → verification → validation
  - Post-market surveillance & corrective action procedures (CAPA)
